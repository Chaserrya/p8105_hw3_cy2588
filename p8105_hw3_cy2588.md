## Problem 1

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

  - How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ... with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles, and fresh vegetables are the most items ordered
from.

  - Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cy2588_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="90%" />

  - Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

  - Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

## Problem 2

### Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data.

``` r
accel_df = 
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "activity.",
    values_to = "activity_count"
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = case_when(
      day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday") ~ "weekend",
      !(day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")) ~ "weekday"
      )
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = as.factor(weekday_vs_weekend),
    day_id = as.factor(day_id), 
    week = as.factor(week),
    day = as.factor(day),
    minute = as.numeric(minute),
    activity_count = as.numeric(activity_count)
    )%>%
 mutate(day = forcats::fct_relevel(day,
                                   c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday", "Saturday","Sunday"))
         ) %>% 
  relocate(day_id, week, weekday_vs_weekend) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  arrange(day, .by_group = TRUE)
```

For now, in the final dataset, there are variables include day\_id,
week, weekday\_vs\_weekend, day, minute, activity\_count, with a total
of 50400 rows and 6 columns, there are 50400 observations.

### Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day.Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(week,day) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity = sum(activity_count))%>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day", 
    values_from = "total_activity")%>% 
knitr::kable()
```

| week |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| :--- | --------: | -------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -----: |
| 1    |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 | 631105 |
| 2    | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 | 422018 |
| 3    | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 | 467052 |
| 4    | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 | 260617 |
| 5    | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 | 138421 |

It seems like activities from Tuesday to Friday are basically stable
during these 5 weeks, however, the activities are significant lower on
Saturday and Sunday in week 4 and 5, especially Saturday.

### Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  group_by(day_id, day, week) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, 
             y = activity_count, 
             color = day, 
             group = day_id)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .1)+
  stat_smooth(se = F, 
              method = "loess") + 
  labs(title = "Activities plot",
       caption = "Data from accelerometer data collected on a 63 year-old male with BMI 25")+
  scale_x_continuous(name ="Hour of day" ,
                     breaks = c(seq(120,1440,120)), 
                     labels = c("2h", "4h", "6h", "8h", "10h", "12h","14h", "16h", "18h","20h", "22h", "24h")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "activity count", 
                      trans = "log10")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cy2588_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="90%" />

Based on this graph, it’s seems that daily active time of this 63
year-old male is basically from around 8am to 10pm, and for weekday, his
activity counts would be higher and with longer active time.

## Problem 3

### Do some data cleaning.

``` r
ny_noaa_df = 
  ny_noaa %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year","month","day")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(year, month, day), as.factor) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(prcp, snow, tmax, tmin), as.numeric) %>%
  mutate(
    prcp = prcp / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10,
    tmin = tmin / 10,
  )
skimr::skim_without_charts(ny_noaa_df)
```

### For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why?

``` r
ny_noaa_df %>%
  filter(snow != "NA") %>%
  count(snow) %>%
  filter(snow >= "0")%>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 280 x 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <dbl>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    25   31022
    ##  3    13   23095
    ##  4    51   18274
    ##  5    76   10173
    ##  6     8    9962
    ##  7     5    9748
    ##  8    38    9197
    ##  9     3    8790
    ## 10   102    6552
    ## # ... with 270 more rows

The most commonly observed value is 0, because It didn’t snow in most of
days.

### Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?

``` r
ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("01","07")) %>% 
  group_by(year, month, id) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_tmax = mean(tmax),na.rm = T
  ) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = mean_tmax,
             color = id,
             group = id)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  geom_path(alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_grid(~ month) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none',
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Average max temperature in January and in July",
       caption = "Data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Temperature(C)")
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cy2588_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

There’s a increasing of max temperature in January from 1981 to 1993,
but it didn’t keep increasing after that. The max temperature of July
are relatively stable. And all the temperature data basically follow the
same variation, and relatively keep same temperature differences between
stations. So, it seems that some stations are always colder or warmer.  
There do have some outliers, such as temperature in January 1982 or in
July 1988 and 2004. They may caused by abnormal weather or just wrong
data.

### Make a two-panel plot

##### plot 1: tmax vs tmin for the full dataset.

``` r
temp_plot = 
  ny_noaa_df %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) + 
   geom_bin2d()+
   labs(title = "tmax vs tmin",
       x = "max temperature(C)",
       y = "min temperature(C)")
```

##### plot 2: the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year.

``` r
snow_plot = 
  ny_noaa_df %>%
  filter(between(snow,1,100))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x= year, y = snow))+
  geom_violin()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
   labs(title = "distribution of snowfall separately by year",
       caption = "Data from NOAA National Climatic Data Center",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Snowfall(mm)")
```

#### combine panels

``` r
temp_plot / snow_plot
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_cy2588_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="90%" />
